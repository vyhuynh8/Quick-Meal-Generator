Description: This is an web application that allows you to generate a quick recipe randomly. This is for when you're not sure what to make for dinner or you're just in the mood to try something new. There's a "LIKE" feature that allows you to save different recipes in case you want to come back to it later.

Tools used: Javascript, HTML/CSS, Skeleton
